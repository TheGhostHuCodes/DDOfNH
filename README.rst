My workspace containing code listings from the Manning liveProject
"`Discovering Disease Outbreaks from News Headlines
<https://www.manning.com/liveproject/discovering-disease-outbreaks-from-news-headlines>`_",
by Leonard Apeltsin and Will Koehrsen.

This project uses `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ for dependency
management. There are also two Jupyter labextension libraries that are used for
development:

- `@ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter
  <https://jupyterlab-code-formatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `@axlair/jupyterlab_vim
  <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axlair/jupyterlab_vim>`_

Note that ``@axlair/jupyterlab_vim`` is a custom build which is a temporary
solution to getting vim bindings working in JupyterLab 2.X until `this
<https://github.com/jwkvam/jupyterlab-vim/pull/115#issuecomment-596098108>`_ PR
is merged.
